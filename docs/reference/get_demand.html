<dt>by</dt>
<dd><p>character, being 'Profile' or 'Session'. When <code>by='Profile'</code> each column corresponds to an EV user profile.</p></dd>


<dt>resolution</dt>

If <code>dttm_seq</code> is defined this parameter is ignored.</p></dd>

    <p>Note that the time resolution of variables <code>ConnectionStartDateTime</code> and
<code>ChargingStartDateTime</code> must coincide with
<code>resolution</code> parameter. For example, if a charging session in <code>sessions</code> starts charging
at 15:32 and <code>resolution = 15</code>, the load of this session won't be computed. To solve this,
the parameter <code>align_time = TRUE</code> would align charging sessions' start time according to
<code>resolution</code>, so following the previous example the session would start at 15:30.</p>
