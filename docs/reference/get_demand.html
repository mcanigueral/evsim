    <p>Note that the time resolution of variables <code>ConnectionStartDateTime</code> and
<code>ChargingStartDateTime</code> must coincide with
<code>resolution</code> parameter. For example, if a charging session in <code>sessions</code> starts charging
at 15:32 and <code>resolution = 15</code>, the load of this session won't be computed. To solve this,
the function automatically aligns charging sessions' start time according to
<code>resolution</code>, so following the previous example the session would start at 15:30.</p>
