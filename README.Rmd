## Overview

evsim is part of a suite of packages to analyse, model and simulate the charging behavior of electric vehicle users:

* [evprof](https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evprof/): Electric Vehicle PROFiling
* [evsim](https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evsim/): Electric Vehicle SIMulation

evsim package provides the functions for:

* Simulating new EV sessions based on Gaussian Mixture Models created with package {evprof}
* Calculating the power demand from a data set of EV sessions in a specific time resolution
* Calculating the occupancy (number of vehicles connected) in a specific time resolution


## Usage

If you have your own data set of EV charging sessions or you have already built your EV model with [evprof](https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evprof/), the best place to start is the [Get started chapter](https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/evsim/articles/evsim.html) in the package website.


## Installation

You can install the package from CRAN or the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# CRAN stable release
install.packages("evsim")

# Latest development version
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("resourcefully-dev/evsim")
```


## Getting help

If you encounter a clear bug, please open an issue with a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/mcanigueral/evprof/issues).
